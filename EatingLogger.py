The purpose of this program is to take the common foods I eat and create daily tallies of caloric intake and protein. 
It takes input from a basic GUI and converts that into JSON data that is then loaded for display, allowing me to export and import logs.
It must use GUI elements, who wants to use the command line for input? Tacky!
